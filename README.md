Bitsouls is a 2D Soulslike with pixel art graphics. Featuring simple but immersive gameplay, walk through the wastelands of what humanity has adapted to be after the gods descended to Earth. Defeat various enemies and defy death most of the time while trying to understand what happened to this unholy world.

Do you have what it takes to restore the grace of humanity and fight against all the agonized souls?

Game developed by Nicolas Risso.

I have utilized various art assets, even thought I made a lot of them myself, and also incorporated free sounds from freesound.org. Credits are given where necessary.
